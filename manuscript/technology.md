# Flask App Outline for Digital Clone Project

## Overview
This markdown outline details the structure and functionality of the Flask application that serves as the backbone for the digital clone technology. The app integrates various AI components for voice cloning, image-to-video conversion, and presentation generation.

## Application Structure

### Core Application Components
- **app.py**: Main Flask application entry point
  - Route handlers for web interface
  - API endpoints for processing requests
  - Integration with database models

### Database Management
- **db.py**: Database schema and models
  - Media type tables (Text, Photo, Video, Audio, PPT)
  - Project management table
  - User authentication tables

### Templates and Frontend
- **templates/**: HTML templates for web interface
  - Main dashboard view
  - Media upload interfaces
  - Project management screens
  - Results/preview displays
  - **submitted_modal_2b.html**: Slide generation interface with JavaScript for media processing

### Media Processing Modules
- **Audio Processing**:
  - Integration with Bark and Play.ht for voice synthesis
  - Voice cloning capabilities
  - Audio quality enhancement

- **Video Processing**:
  - SadTalker integration for talking head generation
  - Image-to-video conversion pipeline
  - Video rendering and optimization

- **Presentation Generation**:
  - PowerPoint slide creation and management
  - Multi-slide support with media integration
  - Presentation assembly from various media types

### API Integrations
- External service connectors for:
  - Voice cloning services (Play.ht, Bark)
  - Talking head generation (SadTalker)
  - Cloud storage solutions

### Utility Functions
- Media format conversion
- File management
- Status tracking for long-running processes
- Error handling and logging

## Workflow Processes
1. **Media Upload**: Users submit text, images, or audio
2. **AI Processing**: Content is processed through appropriate AI models
3. **Media Generation**: New media (audio/video/presentations) is created
4. **Project Association**: Content is organized into user projects
5. **Preview and Export**: Users can preview and export final products

## Deployment and DevOps

The application infrastructure supports multiple deployment options:

### Docker-Based Deployment
- Containerized with Docker for consistent environments
- Docker Compose for local development and testing
- Dockerfile optimized for Python 3.11 with necessary dependencies

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
- Multi-environment deployment support (production, staging, development)
- Automated secret management and environment configuration
- Deployment targets:
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk (production)
  - Google Cloud Run (staging)
  - Manual options for Heroku and DigitalOcean

## Technical Implementation Details
- Flask web framework for backend
- SQLite/SQLAlchemy for database operations
- PyTorch integration for AI model execution
- RESTful API design for service communication
- Asynchronous processing for long-running AI tasks

## Current Development Status
- **Completed**: Basic media processing, PowerPoint generation
- **Partial**: Multi-slide support, project management
- **Planned**: Enhanced user interface, additional AI model integration
