## Introduction

(*V1 Intro Paragraph*) The COVID‑19 pandemic catalyzed an unprecedented shift toward technology‑enhanced instruction across the continuum of medical education. Within months, pre‑clinical lectures, bedside demonstrations, and continuing professional development migrated to virtual or blended formats, prompting accrediting bodies such as the LCME and ACGME to formalize expectations for flexible, on‑demand learning experiences that still meet competency standards [1–3]. Asynchronous, micro‑credential‑oriented content is now viewed not as a supplement, but as a core component of modern curricula, empowering learners to revisit complex topics at their own pace while freeing valuable in‑person time for simulation and team‑based care.

(*V2 Intro Paragraph*) The last five years have seen an unprecedented pivot toward technology‑enhanced instruction in **medical and health‑professions education**. While online enrollment across U.S. higher education soared from 1.6 million learners in 2002 to 6.9 million by 2016 —and nearly doubled again during the COVID‑19 pandemic :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}—medical schools experienced an even sharper shift: 94 % of LCME‑accredited programs reported moving at least half of their pre‑clinical curriculum online between March 2020 and June 2021. Accrediting bodies such as the LCME and ACGME have since formalised expectations for flexible, on‑demand learning that still meets competency standards in areas like telemedicine and informatics. Asynchronous “micro‑credentials” and just‑in‑time modules are now viewed not as ancillary but as core curricular components, allowing trainees to revisit difficult topics while freeing scarce in‑person time for simulation and bedside teaching.

(*V3 Intro Paragraph*) Over the past half‑decade—and at an accelerated pace since the COVID‑19 pandemic—medical and health‑professions programs have shifted large portions of pre‑clinical, clinical‑skills, and continuing‑education curricula into online or blended formats. Accrediting bodies such as the LCME and ACGME now expect institutions to offer flexible, on‑demand learning opportunities that nonetheless meet competency standards in domains ranging from telemedicine to informatics. Asynchronous micro‑modules can relieve scheduling conflicts and support spaced repetition, yet producing professionally edited video at scale remains resource‑intensive.

Despite this momentum, a persistent production bottleneck threatens scalability and equity. Creating high‑quality video modules demands audiovisual expertise, dedicated recording space, captioning, and iterative editing—tasks that fall outside most faculty members’ workload and skill sets [4, 5]. Institutions with limited instructional‑design resources struggle to refresh materials regularly, leading to dated content and under‑representation of diverse instructor voices. These constraints also slow the growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), which depend on freely shareable media yet rarely encompass professionally edited video owing to the time and cost required [6].

Recent advances in neural text‑to‑speech and lip‑synchronization have produced commercially viable “talking‑head” avatar generators capable of converting a single photograph and script into realistic lecture videos within minutes. Pilot studies suggest that avatar‑delivered content can achieve learner engagement and knowledge retention comparable to traditional lecture capture, while dramatically reducing production time [7, 8]. However, existing platforms (e.g., Synthesia, D‑ID) are closed‑source, subscription‑based services that lock institutions into recurring fees, limit extensibility, and raise unresolved questions about data privacy, licensing, and long‑term sustainability [9].

To address these gaps, we designed the **Cloud Learning Studio (CLAS)**—an open‑source, standards‑native pipeline that enables any educator to generate captioned, SCORM‑compliant avatar videos with minimal technical overhead. Design criteria were derived from a literature review and semi‑structured interviews with instructional designers and clinical faculty, emphasizing LMS‑agnostic outputs, WCAG 2.1 accessibility, permissive licensing, and straightforward deployment on commodity hardware or cloud servers.

This manuscript pursues two objectives. First, we chronicle the rapid, version‑by‑version evolution of the Cloud Learning Studio (CLAS), showing how shifting AI model APIs, licensing terms, and hardware constraints repeatedly forced redesign and refactoring during development. Second, we present performance benchmarks for each major version — detailing how architectural adjustments influenced rendering speed, resource utilization, and system stability. 

The sections that follow describe our methods—including development framework, validation protocols, and dissemination strategy—report key results from the CLAS v1.0 release, and discuss how the platform compares with existing solutions, where its limitations lie, and what priorities should guide future multi‑institutional evaluations. We conclude with a call to action for the medical‑education community to leverage, adapt, and extend this open‑source foundation, thereby democratizing high‑quality asynchronous learning for educators and learners alike.
