# Simplified Asset Debug Implementation

## 🎯 Changes Made

### Removed Preview from Jobs Page
- ❌ Removed preview buttons from the main jobs listing
- ❌ Removed `onPreview` functionality and related imports
- ❌ Removed `handlePreview` function
- ❌ Removed `PlayIcon` import
- ❌ Removed `assetService` import

### Enhanced Job Details Modal
- ✅ Added "Asset Information" section to job details modal
- ✅ Shows `asset_ids` array for all assets associated with the job
- ✅ Shows `result_asset_id` for the identified result asset
- ✅ Shows `output_video_id` if available
- ✅ Shows job progress percentage

## 🔍 What You'll See Now

When you click "View Details" on a job, you'll see:

```
Asset Information
├── Asset IDs: 123, 456, 789
├── Result Asset ID: 789
├── Output Video ID: None
└── Progress: 100%
```

This will help you:
1. **Debug which assets are associated** with each job
2. **Verify the result_asset_id logic** is working correctly
3. **See if the right asset is being selected** as the final result
4. **Understand the asset relationships** without preview complexity

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. Start your backend and frontend servers
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/jobs
3. Click "View Details" on any job (especially completed ones)
4. Look at the "Asset Information" section
5. Verify that:
   - `Asset IDs` shows all associated assets
   - `Result Asset ID` shows the selected final result
   - For video jobs, the result should be a video asset (not audio)

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once you can see the asset IDs in the details view:
1. Check if the `result_asset_id` is pointing to the correct asset type
2. If it's still wrong, we can adjust the backend logic further
3. Once the logic is correct, we can re-add preview functionality

This approach gives you full visibility into what's happening with asset selection! 🔍
