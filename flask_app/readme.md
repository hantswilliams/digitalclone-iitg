# Instructions 


## Tailwind 

- Instructions: https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/flask/ 
- Looks like in order to capture some changes, but need to have this running in a terminal, inside of flask_app folder:
    - `npx tailwindcss -i ./static/src/input.css -o ./static/dist/css/output.css --watch`
