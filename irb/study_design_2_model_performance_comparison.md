### Methodology

#### Experimental Design
- **3×3×3 Factorial Design**: 27 total model combinations
- **Within-subjects**: Each participant evaluates 9 combinations (randomly selected)
- **Counterbalanced**: Presentation order randomized to control for learning effects

#### Phase 1: Standardized Input Creation (20 minutes)
1. **Script Development**: Participants select from 5 standardized scripts:
   - Professional presentation (2 minutes)
   - Educational explanation (2 minutes)
   - Personal introduction (1 minute)
   - Product demonstration (2 minutes)
   - Motivational message (1.5 minutes)

2. **Avatar Setup**: Use standardized avatar (same person, professional appearance)

#### Phase 2: Model Evaluation (90 minutes)
1. **Generation Process**: 
   - Create 9 videos using different model combinations
   - Record processing times and system resources
   - Note any errors or failures

2. **Evaluation Tasks** (per video):
   - **Content Quality** (1-7 scale):
     - Script coherence and naturalness
     - Information accuracy
     - Emotional appropriateness
   
   - **Technical Quality** (1-7 scale):
     - Video resolution and clarity
     - Audio quality and clarity
     - Lip synchronization accuracy
     - Facial expression naturalness
   
   - **Overall Assessment**:
     - Preference ranking among the 9 versions
     - Use case suitability ratings
     - Willingness to use in professional settings

#### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis (30 minutes)
1. **Direct Comparison Tasks**:
   - Side-by-side comparison of best/worst versions
   - Identification of specific quality differences
   - Model component attribution (which part was best/worst)

2. **Use Case Matching**:
   - Match optimal model combinations to specific scenarios
   - Rate computational efficiency vs. quality trade-offs

### Primary Outcome Measures
1. **Technical Performance Metrics**:
   - Processing time per model combination
   - System resource utilization
   - Error rates and failure modes

2. **User Satisfaction Scores**:
   - Overall quality ratings (1-7 scale)
   - Preference rankings
   - Use case appropriateness ratings

3. **Model-Specific Performance**:
   - Individual component quality scores
   - Interaction effects between model types

### Data Analysis Plan
1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Three-way ANOVA (LLM × TTS × Video)
   - Processing time regression analysis
   - Quality-efficiency frontier analysis

2. **User Preference Analysis**:
   - Friedman test for preference rankings
   - Multi-criteria decision analysis
   - Cluster analysis for user preference profiles

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Pareto analysis of quality vs. efficiency
   - Decision tree for model selection guidelines

### Ethical Considerations
1. **Data Protection**: Secure handling of generated content
2. **Fair Evaluation**: Blinded assessment where possible
3. **Bias Prevention**: Randomized presentation order
4. **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of model sources and capabilities

### Timeline
- **Setup and Calibration**: 2 weeks
- **Pilot Testing**: 2 weeks
- **Recruitment**: 3 weeks
- **Data Collection**: 6 weeks
- **Analysis**: 4 weeks
- **Reporting**: 3 weeks
- **Total Duration**: 20 weeks

### Resources Required
- High-performance computing setup
- Model API access and credits
- Evaluation software platform
- Statistical analysis software
- Participant compensation ($75 per session)
- Technical support staff

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Performance Benchmarks**: Quantitative comparison across all model combinations
2. **Optimization Guidelines**: Best practices for model selection by use case
3. **Efficiency Analysis**: Cost-benefit analysis of different approaches
4. **User Preference Profiles**: Segmentation of user needs and preferences
5. **Technical Recommendations**: Specific model upgrade paths

### Quality Assurance
1. **Inter-rater Reliability**: Multiple evaluators for subset of videos
2. **Test-retest Reliability**: Repeat evaluations after 1 week
3. **Technical Validation**: Objective metrics (LPIPS, FID scores) for video quality
4. **Process Documentation**: Detailed logging of all generation parameters

### Limitations
1. Limited to English language content
2. Single avatar appearance (limits generalizability)
3. Laboratory setting may not reflect real-world usage
4. Model versions may change during study period

### Significance
This study will provide the first comprehensive comparison of AI model performance in digital avatar generation, enabling evidence-based model selection and optimization strategies for the digital clone platform.
