# Study Design 1: Cross-Cultural Digital Avatar Evaluation Study

## Study Title
"Evaluating Digital Avatar Performance and User Acceptance Across Diverse Demographic Groups: A Cross-Cultural Assessment"

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To assess the performance and user acceptance of AI-generated digital avatars across different demographic groups (race, gender, age) and evaluate potential biases in avatar generation quality.

### Secondary Objectives
1. Measure user preference and comfort levels with digital avatars representing different demographics
2. Assess the technical quality of avatar generation across different facial features and skin tones
3. Identify potential algorithmic biases in voice cloning and video generation
4. Evaluate cultural appropriateness and representation accuracy

## Study Design

### Type
Mixed-methods, cross-sectional evaluation study with within-subjects design

### Participants
- **Target Sample Size**: 120 participants
- **Demographics**: 
  - Age: 18-65 years
  - Gender: Equal distribution across male, female, non-binary
  - Race/Ethnicity: Representative sample including:
    - Caucasian/White (25%)
    - African American/Black (25%)
    - Hispanic/Latino (20%)
    - Asian/Pacific Islander (20%)
    - Native American/Indigenous (5%)
    - Multiracial (5%)
- **Recruitment**: University students, community members, online platforms
- **Inclusion Criteria**: Fluent in English, normal hearing and vision
- **Exclusion Criteria**: Previous experience with avatar creation tools

### Methodology

#### Phase 1: Avatar Creation (30 minutes)
1. **Personal Avatar Creation**: Participants create their own digital avatar
   - Upload 3-5 photos of themselves
   - Record 2-minute voice sample
   - Generate personal digital clone

2. **Demographic Data Collection**:
   - Self-reported demographic information
   - Consent for avatar usage in evaluation

#### Phase 2: Avatar Evaluation (45 minutes)
1. **Technical Quality Assessment**: Participants evaluate 24 pre-generated avatars (4 avatars Ã— 6 demographic categories)
   - Visual realism (1-7 Likert scale)
   - Audio quality and naturalness
   - Lip-sync accuracy
   - Overall believability

2. **Bias Detection Tasks**:
   - Rate avatar "professionalism" 
   - Assess "trustworthiness"
   - Evaluate "likability"
   - Measure unconscious bias through reaction times

#### Phase 3: Preference and Acceptance (30 minutes)
1. **User Preference Survey**:
   - Preferred avatar characteristics
   - Comfort level with different demographic representations
   - Intended use cases for digital avatars

2. **Cultural Appropriateness Assessment**:
   - Evaluate accuracy of cultural representation
   - Identify concerning stereotypes or misrepresentations

### Primary Outcome Measures
1. **Technical Quality Scores**: Mean ratings across demographic groups
2. **Bias Indices**: Difference in ratings between demographic groups
3. **User Acceptance Rates**: Percentage willing to use different avatar types
4. **Cultural Appropriateness Scores**: Ratings from respective demographic groups

### Data Analysis Plan
1. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - ANOVA to compare quality ratings across demographic groups
   - Regression analysis to identify bias predictors
   - Inter-rater reliability assessment

2. **Qualitative Analysis**:
   - Thematic analysis of open-ended responses
   - Cultural appropriateness content analysis

### Ethical Considerations
1. **Privacy Protection**: 
   - Secure storage of participant photos and voice recordings
   - Option to delete personal data after study completion
   - Anonymization of evaluation data

2. **Bias Mitigation**:
   - Diverse research team
   - Cultural sensitivity training for researchers
   - Community advisory board input

3. **Informed Consent**:
   - Clear explanation of avatar creation and usage
   - Separate consent for data retention and future research

### Timeline
- **Recruitment**: 4 weeks
- **Data Collection**: 8 weeks
- **Analysis**: 6 weeks
- **Report Writing**: 4 weeks
- **Total Duration**: 22 weeks

### Resources Required
- Research space with computers and audio equipment
- Survey platform (Qualtrics/REDCap)
- Statistical software (R/SPSS)
- Compensation for participants ($50 per session)
- Research assistant support

### Expected Outcomes
1. Quantitative metrics on avatar quality across demographics
2. Identification of potential algorithmic biases
3. User preference and acceptance data
4. Recommendations for improving cross-cultural avatar generation
5. Framework for ongoing bias monitoring

### Limitations
1. Self-reported demographic data may not capture full diversity
2. Single geographic location may limit generalizability
3. English-only study excludes non-English speakers
4. Snapshot assessment may not capture learning effects

### Significance
This study will provide crucial data on the fairness and cultural sensitivity of digital avatar technology, informing both technical improvements and ethical deployment guidelines.
