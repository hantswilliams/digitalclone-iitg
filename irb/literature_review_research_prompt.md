## Specific Research Questions to Address:

1. What methodologies have been used to evaluate bias in AI-generated visual content?
2. How do cultural backgrounds influence perception of digital avatars?
3. What are the established metrics for measuring avatar quality and realism?
4. What ethical frameworks exist for conducting research with AI-generated human likenesses?
5. How have previous studies addressed demographic representation in AI systems?
6. What are the documented effects of AI bias on different user groups?
7. What mitigation strategies have proven effective for reducing AI bias?
8. How do trust and acceptance of AI systems vary across demographic groups?

## Database and Source Priorities:

## Follow-up Research Prompts

Use these more specific prompts for targeted searches:

### Bias Detection Methodologies:
```
Find academic papers that describe specific methodologies for detecting and measuring bias in AI systems that generate human-like content. Focus on studies that provide quantitative metrics, statistical approaches, and evaluation frameworks that could be adapted for digital avatar assessment.
```

### Cross-Cultural Technology Evaluation:
```
Search for studies that have successfully conducted cross-cultural evaluations of technology systems, particularly those involving human representation or identity. Look for papers that describe participant recruitment strategies, cultural sensitivity protocols, and analysis methods for multi-demographic studies.
```

### Avatar Quality Metrics:
```
Find research papers that establish validated metrics for evaluating digital avatar quality, realism, and user acceptance. Focus on studies that provide standardized scales, objective measurements, and user evaluation frameworks that have been psychometrically validated.
```

### IRB and Ethics Precedents:
```
Look for published studies that have received IRB approval for research involving AI-generated human likenesses, particularly studies that collected biometric data (photos, voice recordings) from diverse populations. Focus on their ethical frameworks, consent procedures, and privacy protection measures.
```

This comprehensive prompt should help you gather the foundational literature needed to support your IRB application and establish the theoretical framework for your cross-cultural digital avatar evaluation study.
