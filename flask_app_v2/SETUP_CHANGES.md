# Development Environment Setup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to support local development of the Flask application without Docker, while keeping supporting services (Redis, PostgreSQL, Celery worker) containerized.

## Files Created:

1. `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Docker Compose configuration that excludes the Flask app but includes Redis, PostgreSQL, and Celery worker
2. `.env.dev` - Environment variables for local development
3. `.env.dev.example` - Example environment file for others to use
4. `dev.sh` - Script to start the development environment
5. `stop_dev.sh` - Script to stop the development environment
6. `status_dev.sh` - Script to check the status of development services
7. `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Detailed documentation for the development setup

## Files Modified:

1. `run.py` - Updated to better handle development environment, load .env.dev file
2. `celery_worker.py` - Updated to better handle development environment, load .env.dev file
3. `README.md` - Updated to include information about the new development setup

## Benefits of This Setup:

1. **Faster Development** - Changes to the Flask app are immediately reflected without rebuilding Docker containers
2. **Easier Debugging** - Can use local debuggers with the Flask app
3. **Simplified Environment** - Supporting services are still containerized for consistency
4. **Better Documentation** - Clear instructions for developers

## How to Use:

1. Run `./dev.sh` to start the development environment
2. Make changes to the Flask app code - they will be immediately reflected
3. Run `./status_dev.sh` to check the status of services
4. Run `./stop_dev.sh` when done to stop all services

## Environment Configuration:

The key environment variables for local development are:
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/digitalclone`
- `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380/0`
- `FLASK_PORT=5002`

These variables connect the local Flask app to the containerized database and Redis services.
